# handymenny/docker-smokeping - based on mad-ady/docker-smokeping

Smokeping keeps track of your network latency. For a full example of what this application is capable of visit [UCDavis](http://smokeping.ucdavis.edu/cgi-bin/smokeping.fcgi). The Smokeping Docker image includes the latest version of Smokeping. It's suitable to run as master/slave. Default configuration needs tweaking, but should allow you to run out of the box.

## TL;DR - Features
* Working configuration for DNS and web-site probes
* Ability to run as a slave

## Usage

Note - you can edit/use `smokeping-master-compose` or `smokeping-slave-compose` with docker-compose after editing them.

Run standalone:

```
docker run \
    --name smokeping-master \
    --hostname smokeping-master \
    -p 9500:80 \
    -e PUID=<UID> -e PGID=<GID> \
    -e TZ=<timezone> \
    -e SMOKEPING_EXTRA_FLAGS="--debug-daemon" \
    -v <path/to/smokeping/smokeping_secrets>:/etc/smokeping/smokeping_secrets \
    -v <path/to/smokeping/data>:/data \
    -v <path/to/smokeping/config>:/config \
    madady/smokeping-influx:latest
```

Run as a slave (connected to docker0):
```
docker run \
    --name smokeping-slave \
    --hostname=smokeping-slave \
    -e PUID=<UID> -e PGID=<GID> \
    -e TZ=<timezone> \
    -e SMOKEPING_EXTRA_FLAGS="--debug-daemon" \
    -e SMOKEPING_MASTER_URL=<http://master.server.url:9500/smokeping/smokeping.cgi> \
    -e SMOKEPING_SHARED_SECRET=<your_secret_goes_here_in_clear_text_unfortunately> \
    madady/smokeping-influx:latest
```
In order to run as a slave you'll need to edit the master configuration, speciffically:
* Add the following to /config/Slaves:
```
+smokeping-slave
display_name=smokeping-slave
color=0000ff
```
* Add slave credentials to smokeping_secrets on the master:
```
smokeping-slave:your_secret_goes_here_in_clear_text_unfortunately
```
* smokeping_secrets file needs to be chmoded 440
* Assign measurements to be done by the slave in /config/Targets:
```
+ slaves
menu = Slave measurement
title = Slave measurement

++ BBC
menu = BBC
title = bbc.co.uk HTTP Latency
host = bbc.co.uk
slaves = smokeping-slave
```
* If you're not getting results back from the slave you need to make the rrd files writable by apache on the master: https://github.com/oetiker/SmokePing/issues/11

## Parameters

`The parameters are split into two halves, separated by a colon, the left hand side representing the host and the right the container side. 
For example with a port -p external:internal - what this shows is the port mapping from internal to external of the container.
So -p 9500:80 would expose port 80 from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port 9500
http://192.168.x.x:9500 would show you what's running INSIDE the container on port 80.`


* `-p 80` - the port for the webUI
* `-v /data` - Storage location for db and application data (graphs etc)
* `-v /config` - Configure the `Targets` file here
* `-e PGID` for for GroupID - see below for explanation
* `-e PUID` for for UserID - see below for explanation
* `-e TZ` for timezone setting, eg Africa/Johannesburg
* `-e SMOKEPING_EXTRA_FLAGS` to pass extra flags to smokeping (it's optional)
* `-e SMOKEPING_MASTER_URL` for a URL to the master instance (causes this container to be a slave)
* `-e SMOKEPING_SHARED_SECRET` the shared secret neede by the slave


This container is based on phusion/baseimage. For shell access whilst the container is running do `docker exec -it smokeping /bin/bash`.

### User / Group Identifiers
Sometimes when using data volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container. We avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`. Ensure the data volume directory on the host is owned by the same user you specify and it will "just work" <sup>TM</sup>.

In this instance `PUID=1001` and `PGID=1001`. To find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id dockeruser
    uid=1001(dockeruser) gid=1001(dockergroup) groups=1001(dockergroup)
```

## Setting up the application 

Once running the URL will be `http://<host-ip>:9500/smokeping/smokeping.fcgi`.

Basics are, edit the Targets file to ping the hosts you're interested in to match the format found there. 
Wait 10 minutes.

## Info

* To monitor the logs of the container in realtime `docker logs -f smokeping`.
